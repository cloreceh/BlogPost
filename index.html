      <p>This has been something I am not sure if I should talk more “publicly” about, but if it can help educate or empower other women to advocate for themselves, then it’s worth it. 
        The picture included in this post may be a bit misleading at first glance, but there’s no pregnancy announcement here. But this post will be long, so feel free to skip, 
        especially if you are one of those that details of reproductive systems makes you uncomfortable. This one is not for you lol.</p>
      <p>Today has been nearly three years in the making.</p>
      <p>It all began with a routine pelvic exam and Pap smear appointment to renew my birth control in January of 2022. Mid-exam, the random physician assistant I booked
         the last minute appointment with paused abruptly and asked, "Did you know you have a septum?" At that point in my life, I had had nearly seven years of annual 
         exams without any mention of this anomaly from any doctor.
      </p>
      <p>An ultrasound was ordered (picture included here), which revealed a complete septum—a piece of extra tissue dividing my uterus, cervix, and vagina into two separate 
        parts. In simpler terms (and perhaps a bit crudely), my reproductive system was essentially split in half. This happens in utero, basically making this a congenital birth defect.
      </p>
      <p>I was referred to a few specialists, including a fertility doctor. They see the most septum cases, since usually a uterine septum is discovered only after 
        multiple miscarriages or pregnancy complications. Septums don’t have any vascular structure, so when an embryo implants in the uterus, after about 6-8 weeks it needs 
        that structure and the nutrients it gets from the uterine wall, and since in my case there’s an extremely high chance it implants in septum (~93%) the pregnancy can’t 
        progress any further. And even if it does implant properly, it won’t have as much room to grow as a normal uterus, and so still-birth, early labor and breech are all 
        complications from septums on top of miscarriage. Since my septum is extensive, the fertility specialist recommended immediate surgical correction to avoid potential miscarriages or pregnancy losses.
      </p>
      <p>However, I encountered another obstacle: the doctor originally scheduled for my surgery was only comfortable performing a partial procedure 
        (just the vaginal portion). Given my looming 26th birthday and having to go on my own insurance, I opted for that surgery in June 2022, hoping it would at least improve 
        my comfort. Afterwards, I chose a birth control implant (Nexplanon) for three years, giving myself time to decide what I wanted to do, whether to pursue full 
        corrective surgery or potentially a partial hysterectomy, or some form of permanent birth control.
      </p>
      <p>Over these years, Ian and I had many conversations about children. While we still don’t know any specifics and don’t know when we’ll be ready to have kids, we 
        wanted to keep the option open. And also I realized, if possible, I would want to experience the pregnancy of our child myself. So, knowing things take time and that 
        my birth control was hitting its expiration, last fall, I restarted the process to determine whether corrective surgery was viable
      </p>
      <p>In October, I was referred to the University of Minnesota Gynecology Department, specifically to a faculty expert. Unfortunately, due to a scheduling mix-up, I saw a 
        medical resident instead. This appointment was frustrating, and one of the worst I’ve had ever. They didn’t seem to review my chart very well, and they (incorrectly) 
        diagnosed with uterine didelphys (two separate uteruses), a condition that cannot be surgically corrected, and instead usually is helped with fertility treatments or 
        IVF. I left that appointment really confused and just wondering where else to go. I wanted a second opinion, but didn’t know where else to turn to.
      </p>
      <p>Thankfully, days later, another doctor reviewed my case and recommended an MRI. This imaging confirmed my original diagnosis: uterine septum. But another negative
         for the U of M, the follow-up from the clinic took over two weeks, so I decided to take matters into my own hands and find a doctor myself who would actually help me.
      </p>
      <p>Remembering my earlier consultation with the fertility specialist, I reached out to obtain the name of her recommended surgeon. They went a step further and sent 
        a referral for me directly to Dr. Kahn at Mayo Clinic. Mayo Clinic was incredible, had the best phone service, and got me on the books that very same day.
      </p>
      <p>I cannot stress this enough, Mayo is exceptional. I wasn’t initially able to get in with Dr. Kahn for the initial consult, but the doctor I saw meticulously 
        reviewed my (admittedly extensive) medical history, affirming the uterine septum diagnosis. A month later (and one gallbladder less), I met with Dr. Kahn, the surgeon who would handle my case. He talked with us for nearly an hour, and was the most supportive, compassionate, and knowledgeable doctor I have ever seen, and we left that appointment with a date for surgery, April 9th.
      </p>
      <p>Now, here we are in Rochester, ready for surgery to correct my reproductive system. While a pregnancy isn't an announcement that we're expecting anytime soon, 
        it's empowering to reclaim control over this aspect of my life. My risk of recurrent miscarriage will dramatically drop—from 93% to just 5%. Living in a state 
        supportive of women's reproductive choices feels especially important today. While deciding to have kids is a decision both Ian and I need to make together, 
        he’s been so supportive in all of this. He’s maintained that ultimately whether to pursue surgery or not is my choice and has come with me to every appointment 
        and follow up, including all of the appointments here in Rochester.
      </p>
      <p>This journey has been stressful and emotional, but today I’m excited to have it mostly over. I'm grateful for the power to choose for myself what I want to do, 
        and being able to hopefully simply let nature decide.</p>
